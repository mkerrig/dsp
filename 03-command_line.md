ls - list the contents of a directory
cd "FILENAME HERE" - change directory to the designated file location
clear - clear the screen
ssh - "IP-ADDRESS" ssh into a remote computer
man - "COMMAND NAME HERE" gives the manual on a given  command
cp - "FILENAME DESTINATION" - copy files
mv - "FILENAME DESTINATION" - moves files
mkdir - "DIRECTORYNAME" - makes a directory
rmdir - "DIRECTORYNAME" - remove a directory
rm - "FILENAME" -removes files

What does `ls` do? What do `ls -a`, `ls -l`, and `ls -lh` do? What combinations of those flags are meaningful?

list contents of a directory, ls -a , doesn't ignore files starting with . , ls -lh is a human readable file size, you can use both to not ignore files starting with . and make it a human readable file size as well so ls -a -lh, and ls -l makes it a long listing style instead of block, so you could do all three to get the ., size, and long listing format, any combination would be meaningful
